# LeetCode-Algorithms
My notes on LeetCode Algorithms based on difficulty

My notes on specific Algorithms in C++
- Starting off notes from https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/C-Plus-Plus <br/>
- All original code by myself is in the Easy, Medium, and Hard folders, otherwise it is marked in a comment as being written by myself or by another source.






<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
'C-Plus-Plus' folder contains files from TheAlgorithms github, containing their original guidelines, code of conduct, etc. that I wanted to keep in place.
